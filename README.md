# Find-Structure-Water-in-the-Binding-Site
This is a Python script to find the water molecules which can form the hydrogen bonding with both the protein and the ligand.
These water molecules play important role in the interaction between the protein and the ligand. 
Please read the following blog before you use this script. The Python script is used to replace the second BASH script.
The python script only cost less than 1 min. But the BASH scirpt will cost more than 5 hours.
